The Risk of Fido is a strategic arcade experience developed for the Brackeys Game Jam 2025. Built by an 8-person multidisciplinary team, the project focuses on high-stakes gameplay mechanics and a cohesive aesthetic delivered within a 7-day development window.

Development Strategy: The Pivot

This project is a case study in adaptive game development. At the midpoint of the jam, the development team faced a significant technical bottleneck that threatened the final delivery.

To ensure a stable and playable build, the team executed a strategic pivot:

Feature Realignment: The scope was reduced by 60%, transitioning from a high-volume content plan to a "polish-first" approach.

Core Loop Optimization: Resources were reallocated to perfect the "Minimum Viable Fun" (MVF) components, prioritizing game feel and stability over non-essential features.

Communication Framework: Structured synchronization protocols were established between the Design and Programming departments to streamline asset integration and bug resolution during the final 48 hours.

Technical Systems

Team Coordination: Management of a remote, 8+ person team across different time zones and disciplines (Art, Programming, Sound, Narrative).

Scope Discipline: Implementation of a strict "Feature Freeze" 12 hours before the deadline to allow for final QA and build stability.

Iterative Polish: Rapid integration of feedback from internal playtests to balance difficulty curves and player progression.

Tech Stack
Engine: Godot

Version Control: Git / GitHub

Collaboration Tools: Discord, Trello, Notion

Outcomes

Stability: Delivered a fully functional, stable build with zero critical bugs at the time of submission.

Cohesion: Achieved a high level of aesthetic and mechanical unity despite a major mid-jam design pivot.

Performance: Optimized for consistent frame rates and low-latency input response.
